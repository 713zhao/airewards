  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>AI Rewards ("the Service") is a family-focused task and reward management application designed to help parents and children structure daily responsibilities and positive reinforcement. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect personal information associated with your family accounts. By using the Service you consent to the practices described herein.</p>
  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect account identifiers (such as user IDs, email addresses for parent accounts), family grouping identifiers, task data, reward suggestions, point totals, and device/runtime metadata required for performance and debugging. Child accounts may omit email addresses where configured. No sensitive biometric, financial, or government ID data is collected.</p>
  <h2>Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Collected information is used to: (1) render task lists and reward catalogs; (2) synchronize progress across devices; (3) allow parents to approve, reject, or modify reward suggestions; (4) generate analytics related to feature usage and performance optimization; and (5) secure accounts and prevent abuse.</p>
  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. Limited aggregated, anonymized metrics may be analyzed internally to improve reliability and user experience. Access to raw user data is restricted to systems required for operation. Third-party services (e.g., Firebase) process data under their own compliant terms.</p>
  <h2>Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The Service may use browser storage for session tokens, caching configuration, and optimization flags. No cross-site tracking cookies are intentionally set by us. Ads served via Google AdSense may use their own mechanisms according to Google's policies; you can manage personalized ad settings via Google.</p>
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Data is transmitted over encrypted channels (HTTPS) and stored using Firebase security rules to enforce family-based access control. We regularly review authentication flows and role-based permissions. Despite reasonable safeguards, no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>
  <h2>Children's Data</h2>
  <p>Child profiles are intended to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information. Parents manage and can delete associated data at any time. If any regulatory removal request arises, contact us via the information below.</p>
  <h2>Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Data persists while the family account remains active. Parents may request deletion of a family and its associated child data; deleted data is generally removed from active storage within 30 days, subject to backup cycles.</p>
  <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy to reflect improvements or legal compliance adjustments. Continued use after changes implies acceptance. The "Last Updated" date will indicate revisions.</p>
  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or deletion requests email: <a href="mailto:713.zhao@gmail.com">713.zhao@gmail.com</a></p>
